<p>This repo contains tools I created using Jupyter Widgets.</p>

<h2>slider_widget.ipynb</h2>

<p>This is a collection of tools that use IntSlider and Checkbox. The tools
do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>find the sum of the values of three variables.</li>
<li>plot the graph of a line for varying slopes and y-intercepts</li>
<li>create a scatter plot of n points where the y-coordinate 
is taken from the discrete uniform distributions of integers less than 20, and 
display the regression line, residuals, equation, and correlation coefficient.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>dropdown_widget.ipynb</h2>

<p>This is a tool that uses the tips dataset from the seaborn package and creates
different plots using a categorical variable in the x-axis and a numerical
variable in the y-axis. It can also group the plots according to another categorical
variable. The plots that the tool can create are: strip plots, box plots, swarm plots, and
violin plots.</p>
